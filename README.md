# E-Commerce React Project - JavaScript Frameworks CA

## Description

E-Commerce React Store is a responsive online shop application built with React. It allows users to browse products, view detailed information, manage a shopping cart, and proceed through a checkout process. The site also includes a contact form for user inquiries.

The goal of this project was to apply knowledge from the JavaScript Frameworks module by building a practical frontend solution that consumes a public API.


### Highlights:
- Dynamic product listing from an external API
- Full cart functionality with item management
- Contact form with validation
- Responsive design using Bootstrap

`https://v2.api.noroff.dev/online-shop`
